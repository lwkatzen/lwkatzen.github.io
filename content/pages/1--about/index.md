title: About
---

Senior at the University of Utah studying mathematics and (sometimes) physics. I am currently most interested in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, but hope to learn more number theory in the near future.

Next year, I will attend Part III in maths at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html) with funding from the [Churchill Scholarship](https://churchillscholarship.org/). At Utah, I am completing my honors thesis in mathematics under Anurag Singh, and have previously benefited from the mentorship of Karl Schwede and Thomas Polstra.

I also owe thanks to the excellent Zhirayr Avetisyan, who mentored me during the summer of 2019 at UC Santa Barbara; Ignacio Darago, who mentored me during the summer of 2020 at the University of Chicago; and Adam Boocher, who initially set me down my path in mathematics and continues to offer friendly advice and help many years later. During my early years at the University of Utah, I was lucky to briefly work in Dr. Vikram Deshpande and Dr. Yue Zhao's research groups.

I am fortunate to have received funding from the [Eccles scholarship](https://honors.utah.edu/eccles-scholarship/) during my four years at the University of Utah, as well as from the [Goldwater scholarship](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/).
